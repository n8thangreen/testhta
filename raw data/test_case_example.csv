T01,QALY estimation,discount rate = 1,,All QALYS = 0,,,,
T02,QALY estimation,discount rate = 0,,QALYS = LE,,,,
T03,Clinical trajectory,,,All treatments produce equal estimates of total LYGs and total QALYs,,,"Set relative treatment effect (odds ratios, relative risks or hazard ratios) parameter(s) to 1.0 (including adverse events)",Tappenden ()
T04,Clinical trajectory,,,Total probability equals 1.0,,,Sum expected health state populations at any model timepoint (state transition models),Tappenden ()
T05,Clinical trajectory,,,Total probability equals 1.0,,,Sum expected probability of terminal nodes (decisiontree models),Tappenden ()
T06,QALY estimation,,,QALY gains equal LYGs,,,Set all health utility for living states parameters to 1.0,Tappenden ()
T07,QALY estimation,,,Discounted QALYs = undiscounted QALYs for all treatments,,,Set QALY discount rate to 0,Tappenden ()
T08,QALY estimation,,,QALY gain after time 0 tend towards zero,,,Set QALY discount rate equal to very large number,Tappenden ()
T09,Cost estimation,,,ICER is reduced,,,Set intervention costs to 0,Tappenden ()
T10,Cost estimation,,,ICER is increased,,,Increase intervention cost,Tappenden ()
T11,Cost estimation,,,Discounted costs = undiscounted costs for all treatments,,,Set cost discount rate to 0,Tappenden ()
T12,Cost estimation,,,Costs after time 0 tend towards zero,,,Set cost discount rate equal to very large number,Tappenden ()
T13,Input parameters,,,"Range of sampled parameter values does not violate characteristics of statistical distribution used to describe parameter (e.g., samples from beta distribution lie in range 0\x \1, samples from lognormal distribution lie in range x[0, etc.)",,,Produce n samples of model parameter m,Tappenden ()
T14,General,,,Costs and QALYs equal for all treatments,,,Set all treatment-specific parameters equal for all treatment groups,Tappenden ()
T15,General,,,ICER is changed,,,Amend value of each individual model paramete,Tappenden ()
T16,General,,,QALYs and costs for each option should be switched,,,Switch all treatment-specific parameter values,Tappenden ()
